# Company Website (GitHub Pages)

A minimal, modern static site for a software studio. Ready for GitHub Pages.

## Quick start

1. Create a repository named `<org>.github.io` (for an organization) or `<username>.github.io` (for a user).
2. Copy these files into the repo root and push.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, choose the `main` branch as the source (or keep the default GitHub Actions workflow included here).
4. (Optional) Set a **Custom domain** and add a `CNAME` file containing your domain (e.g., `www.example.com`). Point DNS `www` to `<org>.github.io` with a CNAME.
