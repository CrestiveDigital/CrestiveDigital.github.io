        <h1>Gregory Hudler</h1>
        <p class="muted">Software Engineer / Co-Founder</p>
        <p>
          Gregory Hudler is a Co-founder of Crestive Digital, an independent mobile development studio dedicated to creating original software and games. With over 15 years of experience in IT systems, 
            software engineering, and digital design, Gregory blends technical depth with creative vision.  Before founding Crestive Digital, he worked as a systems administrator and technical lead across 
            enterprise infrastructure, cybersecurity, and cloud operations. That experience sharpened his focus on building scalable, reliable products. Today, he applies those skills to the studio’s in-house 
            projects, bringing original concepts to the studio’s portfolio of apps and games, including:
            <ul>
        <li>LucidPaths – a productivity and goal-tracking app with intelligent task dependencies.</li>
        <li>KinKitchen – a recipe-sharing and cookbook platform for families and communities.</li>
        <li>Resonance – a narrative-driven mobile game exploring time and survival.</li>
        <li>MyConcept.cloud – a creative notebook for writers and storytellers.</li>
      </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Gregory is passionate about designing polished user experiences, sustainable architectures, and storytelling that connects. His work is driven by the belief that great software should feel as 
            human as it is powerful.
