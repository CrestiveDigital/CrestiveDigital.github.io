        <h1>Gregory Hudler</h1>
        <p class="muted">Software Engineer / Co-Founder</p>
        <p>
          Gregory Hudler is the Co-founder of Crestive Digital, an independent studio dedicated to building original software and games. With over 15 years of combined experience in IT systems, 
          software engineering, digital design, and military communications, Gregory brings a unique balance of technical depth, leadership, and creative vision to his work.
        </p>
       
        <p>
          Gregory’s career began in the United States Marine Corps, where he served in multiple roles including Network Specialist, Data Chief, Platoon Sergeant, 
          and Electronic Key Management systems Custodian. He designed and maintained secure network architectures, built domains, and managed cryptographic hardware and 
          software systems vital to mission success. He deployed twice to Afghanistan, and during his second deployment was the Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC / senior enlisted Marine) responsible for the 
          entire forward operating base’s communications, ensuring critical uptime and security under combat conditions.
        </p>
         <p>
          Following his military service, Gregory expanded into the private sector as a systems administrator and technical lead, gaining extensive real-world experience in helpdesk, 
          enterprise infrastructure, cybersecurity, and cloud operations. This breadth of expertise sharpened his focus on building scalable, reliable, and secure products.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the technical, Gregory is also a visionary creative writer and independent filmmaker, pairing engineering precision with a storyteller’s imagination. 
          At Crestive Digital, he channels both worlds into the studio’s portfolio, ensuring every project reflects both resilience in architecture and richness in design.
          </p>
        <p> 
          Today, he applies those skills to the studio’s in-house 
            projects, bringing original concepts to the studio’s portfolio of apps and games, including:
            <ul>
        <li>LucidPaths – a productivity and goal-tracking app with intelligent task dependencies.</li>
        <li>KinKitchen – a recipe-sharing and cookbook platform for families and communities.</li>
        <li>Resonance – a narrative-driven mobile game exploring time and survival.</li>
        <li>MyConcept.cloud – a creative notebook for writers and storytellers.</li>
      </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Gregory is passionate about designing polished user experiences, sustainable architectures, and storytelling that connects. His work is driven by the belief that great software should feel as 
            human as it is powerful.
